# Pychat

PychatBack -> https://github.com/Fansu7/chat-back
--------------------

Pychat is a little project targeting on learning how to use websockets.
The basic idea is to use FastAPI to create a token when an user logs in, decode that token in Angular and open a websocket so the user can chat in real time with other users.
